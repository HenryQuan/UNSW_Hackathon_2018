# Testing project
This is for testing only. It is created in order to see if we could all run it on our devices so that we could collaborate easily.
# Try running this project
```
cd test
react-native run-android | react-native run-ios
```
Windows could only run android whereas Mac could run both as long as you have both Android Studio and Xcode.
